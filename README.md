TrashReduce is an iOS application developed by Sidki Amri and Mohamed Taha Mejoub. It is designed to promote recycling and reduce waste by providing users with a platform to participate in clean-up events, earn rewards, and locate recycling bins. The application aims to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the environment and encourages users to actively contribute to waste reduction efforts.

Features
Home Screen
The home screen of TrashReduce displays a list of upcoming clean-up events. Users can browse through the events and access detailed information about each event. By participating in these events, users contribute to cleaning up the environment and making a positive impact.

Profile Screen
The profile screen contains personalized information about the user. Users can view their profile details, including their name, contact information, and their current point balance. TrashReduce implements a reward system where users can earn points by adding new recyclable materials. These points can be redeemed for various rewards, such as a T-shirt featuring their favorite sports team.

Map Screen
The map screen shows the locations of nearby recycling bins. Users can easily locate the nearest recycling facilities and make informed decisions about disposing of their waste responsibly. Additionally, the application provides notifications when a user is in close proximity to a recycling bin, encouraging them to recycle and earn points.

Add New Item Screen
The "Add New Item" screen allows users to contribute to the recycling efforts by reporting the disposal of specific materials. For example, users can report the recycling of plastic items or other types of waste. By confirming the recycling action, users earn 5 points that contribute to their reward balance.
